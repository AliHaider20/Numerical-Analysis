## Satellite positioning system
Problem statement: Find two accurate co-ordinates in the surface of the Earth using three co-ordinates of satellites.

## Stewart platform
This project concerns a two-dimensional version of the Stewaart platform. It will model a manipulator composed of a triangular platform in a fixed plane controlled by three struts. Finding the position of the platform, given the three strut lengths, is called the forward kinematics problem for this manipulator. Below steps indicate the flow of the project work in a sequential manner.
